# **TrustAPT (TAPT) - APTOS Blockain for Transfer APT Tool** 
## [Visual Design](https://www.figma.com/design/x26nsseAYFjYXvAKAV0W56/Visual-Design-for-Decentralize-Splitter?node-id=1669-162202&t=WZHmayhbnCgHwmKV-1)

## **üîç Overview**
TrustAPT (TAPT) is a decentralized application built on the APTOS blockchain that enables users to send APT tokens securely in split group expenses.
it allows a user to create an expense, invite contributors (participants), and automatically distribute funds to a recipient once the total amount is collected all in a transparent and tamper-proof way using Move Smart contract.

## üîó Future Core Features

| Features | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| **Create Expense** |	Creator sets up the group expense and defines key details. |
|	**Track Contributions**	|	Each participant‚Äôs APT contribution is tracked on-chain.
|	**Auto Settlement**			|	Once the total amount is reached, funds are sent automatically.
|	**Escrow Mechanism**		|	Funds are held temporarily by the creator‚Äôs account until settlement.
|	**Immutable Records**		|	All data is stored on-chain via Aptos smart contracts.

## üîê How TrustAPT Works (Flow Summary)
- User connects wallet.
- Creator creates expense (total amount, recipient, list of participants).
- Participants contribute APT using the DApp interface.
- Once fully funded, the smart contract automatically settles the payment by sending funds to the recipient.
- Expense is marked as settled and becomes immutable.
  
## üìå Example Use Cases
- Splitting vacation costs among friends.
- Group gift purchases.
- Shared rent or utility payments.
- Event expenses (parties, meetups).
